    <p>Our Economy : An Aid To The Value Of Dollar.
        It’s a cool evening at the East part of Lagos state, mama Janet is in the kitchen awaiting  the  arrival of Janet who she has send on an errand to get her a derica rice for the family’s dinner. But she was astound when Janet came back with nothing, what’s the problem? Asked mama Janet.  Janet replied that the money she was given was not enough. why won’t it be enough, I asked you to get a derica rice which is #250, why are you now saying you’re short of 100. “Mummy, uncle Emeka said that dollar is high, so also is the price of every goods in the market “ Janet replies. Ha! God save us from this our Government o, they keep increasing the price of dollar to Naira every-time. Mama Janet lament.
       Like mama Janet, everyone blame the government, but we all are the cause of this, we have one way or the other contribute to our Economy, which aids the value of dollar against Naira. Both the learned and unlearned contribute to the rise in dollar against Naira. There are numerous factors that determine the value of a country currency and these factors are not being followed by us, and if we keep threading on this path, our already weak economy would soon crumble, and this will have adverse effect on an average Nigerian, even Nigerians abroad are being affected by this, as the huge amount of money being sent to them becomes peanut when being converted to foreign currencies..</P>
